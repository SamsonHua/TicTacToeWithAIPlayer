#Welcome to my first Python Project!
I did this project a while ago while I was learning the tkinter library as well as the python language itself.
This Tic Tac Toe will automatically play tic tac toe with you and will employ a logical sequence of moves as opposed to random moves.
Because of the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, there are some instances where you will lose regardless because of how the game is structured!
